I am a PhD candidate in the [Stanford Autonomous Agents Lab](https://www.autonomousagents.stanford.edu/), advised by [Nick Haber](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicholas-haber). My research focuses on two key areas:

* **Social Intelligence in Language Models**: I develop LLM-based agents with theory-of-mind capabilities, and evaluation frameworks to assess how LLMs comprehend and reason in social situations.

* **Scaling Properties of Agents**:  I investigate how tool use and reasoning capabilities scale with inference-time compute in LLM-based agents, characterizing the relationship between computational resources and effective problem-solving.
