My research investigates how to build intelligent agents that can learn and reason effectively in dynamic environments. Through my work with large language models, I develop agents with social cognitive abilities to understand and interact with humans and other agents. I'm currently focused on enhancing agents' reasoning through tool use and search-augmented inference, enabling them to decompose and solve complex tasks. My goal is to create agents that can learn and adapt through meaningful interactions with their environment.
