I am a PhD candidate in the [Stanford Autonomous Agents Lab](https://www.autonomousagents.stanford.edu/), advised by [Nick Haber](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicholas-haber). My research focuses on advancing artificial intelligence in two key areas:

* **Social Intelligence in Language Models**: I develop evaluation frameworks to assess how language models comprehend and reason in social situations, helping improve social evaluations.

* **Tool-Augmented Reasoning**: I explore methods for enhancing language models' problem-solving capabilities by enabling them to effectively utilize external tools .
